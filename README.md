## Installation
  To use from the developer side, please clone code, npm install and create the database in postgres as well as run the seeds.js file prior to starting the server.
  
## Usage
  This application can be used to create an account on the site and log in to view your account. From there, you can navigate to different events by selecting the title of the post as listed on the homepage. Once on the individual event page, you can view the title of the event, the author, the content of the post/event details, where the event is taking place and any users who have marked themselves as attendees. There is also functionality to logout and be redirected to the homepage. Future development to include functionality to add a new event and react to events with comments and attendance.
